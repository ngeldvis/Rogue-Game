# Rogue Game

A rogue game made using Java and swing! This was a school project I completed in second year in my Object Oriented Programming ([CIS 2430](https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2018-2019/courses/cis2430.shtml)) course

### Main Acomplishments

* Developed an ASCII roguelike game where the user can move through various rooms picking up and
using items
* Created a GUI to show the current room as well as the playerâ€™s items with the option to open
previously saved game states
* Applied fundamental Object-Oriented Design concepts such as polymorphism, abstraction, and the
single-responsibility principle
